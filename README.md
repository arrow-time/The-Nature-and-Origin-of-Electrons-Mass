# The Nature and Origin of Electrons Mass

The Nature and Origin of Lepton Mass:
In this model, the electron possesses an internal structure, and its spin arises from the field excitation of this structural rotation. Such a spinorial field excitation can distort spacetime, while the near-light-speed tangential velocity of the electron's rotation corresponds to a spatial twist that generates a spherically divergent gravitational field. The mass of the electron is fundamentally the result of the external spacetime stretching—manifested as a gravitational field—induced by this rotating spinorial distortion. This can equivalently be understood as the inertial mass described by relativity.

From this perspective, the electron mass calculated in this theoretical model is inherently inertial mass, and the speed-of-light constraint applies equally to the tangential excitation wave velocity at the electron's surface. Under this understanding and constraint, recalculating the electron's radius yields a self-consistent result where the tangential velocity never exceeds the speed of light.

The flaw in traditional theoretical calculations lies in their presupposition that the electron's mass is rest mass, thereby underestimating the relativistic inertial mass. This leads to an overestimated radius and, consequently, a paradoxical derivation of superluminal tangential velocity. In contrast, this model eliminates the paradox: the electron's rest mass approaches zero, is not governed by chromodynamics, and is instead dominated purely by the dynamic spinorial field excitation of the Higgs mechanism—an inertial mass framework free of contradictions.
